# Abstract Factory Pattern

This pattern provides the creational strategy through the abstract layer without having to know about the concrete creator class.

The example added deals with creating a Data Access Layer through Abstract Factory pattern for 2 types of Databases. If any other types of database needs to be added, only it's respective concrete class can be added. (The Data Access Layer need not be touched)
