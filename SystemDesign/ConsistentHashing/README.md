# Consistent Hashing

Consistent Hashing is a hashing technique, which allows a minimal numbers of keys to be remapped when a hashtable's size changes. 

This is widely used in assigning objects to the server in a effective manner as this is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table by assigning them a position on an abstract circle, or hash ring. This allows servers and objects to scale without affecting the overall system.
